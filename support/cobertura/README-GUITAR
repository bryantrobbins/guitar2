This is a modified verion of cobertura 1.9.3 by the GUITAR group to collect extra experiment data

I. Build cobertura with jar task   
	ant jar
   After this step there is a cobertura.jar file in the root
directory. Use this file for collecting code coverage.

II. Collect additional method and class coverage information 
	- Use cobertura-mod-report.sh instead of cobertura-report.sh

III. Code profiling

1. Add cobertura.jar to your classpath as we often do when measuring coverage  with cobertura.
Follow this link for the detail instruction on how to instrument code and run the instrumented version with cobertura: http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/

2. Enable  GUITAR flags in the java call:

- -Dedu.cs.umd.guitar.console: Print code trace directly to the terminal.
	
	Example
		java -Dedu.cs.umd.guitar.console -cp cobertura.jar:intr:bin RadioButton 

- -Dedu.cs.umd.guitar.tracefile=<out put trace file>: Record trace to file after each run. 
	
	Exampe:
		java -Dedu.cs.umd.guitar.tracefile=Demo.trc -cp cobertura.jar:intr:bin RadioButton 

- The flags can be both enabled at the same time
